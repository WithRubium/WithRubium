### 👋 Hi There!

Let's begin this README with a fictional story.

> _Have you ever wondered who WithRubium is? I mean, all the people in town knows she's a compassionate, helpful and cute girl. Aged only 19, she is the probably most known figure in this town, maybe we shall call her, a "local celebrity"?_
> 
> _But there is a problem - nobody knows the another side of this girl.... yet. She only emerges from her home after the sunset, and she is often seen carrying a bottle of red liquid when going out of the house or going into the house, and not to mention that every time when people sees her, they claims that they sees Rubium having "bloody red glowing eyes" and sometimes "very long fangs from two sides". There are witnesses claiming that "She looks like absolutely thirsty of blood"._
> 
> _However, when people asked her about all these, she just walks away like she doesn't care about all of this. She's still that compassionate, helpful and cute girl, that starts to get known way back when she is just 14. But I believe that there something is terribly wrong._
>
> _Question remains. Is WithRubium....... a.... vampire?_
